RobotPy is a community of FIRST mentors and students dedicated to developing
python-related projects for the FIRST Robotics Competition. The primary
project we develop are packages of Python 3 and WPILib for the roboRIO
platform intended for use in FRC. Teams can use this to write their robot
code using Python, a powerful dynamic programming language.

Python is not an official FRC language yet, but we are working with the WPILib team to make it official in 2024. See https://wpilib.org/blog/bringing-python-to-frc for the announcement.

To get started, see our [getting started guide](http://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html).
